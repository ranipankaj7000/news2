        <h1>​Elon Musk’s version of Twitter splutters, but where are the alternatives?</h1>
        <p>If this is indeed the beginning of the end for social media giants Twitter, perhaps the only thing left to do is tweet about it?</p>

        <p>Elon Musk walking into Twitter headquarters on October 27, holding a kitchen sink, has quickly become a defining image. If there was an element of his hand being forced, by having to honour the deal he first mooted, it seemed well hidden behind the wide grin. Things have been capricious since, at Twitter’s global offices.</p>
        <p>Flagging off an increasingly erratic leadership, were the global layoffs. Twitter now faces a class action lawsuit, as a result. Those layoffs have since been expanded, with 4,400 contract workers cut. Earlier today, the Elon Musk imposed deadline for an “extremely hardcore” Twitter 2.0 has not exactly worked out as planned – hundreds of remaining Twitter employees have not clicked “yes” on the Google Form that was shared in the email, and do not agree to the vision of “working long hours at high intensity” and “only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade”.</p>
        <p>The Elgar case pertains to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, according to police, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the city's outskirts. One person was killed and several others were injured in the violence..</p>
        <p>It may be concerning that employees who haven’t accepted this new vision statement might be let go as well, further reducing Twitter’s workforce, including entire departments and teams. For instance, Twitter no longer has a communications team. The smaller workforce strength may become a challenge in case technical issues crop up during the FIFA World Cup 2022 Qatar, which begins in a few days, and is expected to drive a lot of interaction on social media platforms.</p>
