        <p>Rahul Gandhi's criticism of Savarkar and Uddhav Thackeray's disapproval of it has nothing to do with the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on Friday. He said he spoke to Sanjay Raut on the issue and asked him whether this will weaken the alliance that the Congress had entered into with the Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and the Nationalist Congress Party in 2019 and Sanjay Raut said, 'no'. The row comes as Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra is in Maharashtra – the birthplace of Savarkar. Uddhav Thackeray was invited to the yatra but he did not join while his son, former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray joined the yatra and walked along with Rahul Gandhi.</p>
        <p>However, speaking to the media on Friday, Sanjay Raut said Congress leaders in Maharashtra won't support Rahul Gandhi's comments on Savarkar. "Coming to Maharashtra and saying things about Savarkar won't be accepted. Congress leaders won't support him. Bharat Jodo Yatra is against dictatorship and issues like unemployment, inflation and Congress is getting support," Sanjay Raut said.</p>
        <p>“Giving such a statement can cause strife in MVA. We believe in Veer Savarkar and we want to ask the fake Hinduvaadi that we are demanding Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar for 10 years. Even though BJP is in power, why are they not fulfilling our demands?” Sanjay Raut asked.</p>
        <p>Jairam Ramesh, however, said he had a long discussion with Sanjay Raut over the Savarkar issue. "I had a long discussion with Sanjay Raut. I told him that Rahul Gandhi had spoken his mind and the same was the case with your leadership. It has nothing to do with the MVA coalition," Jairam Ramesh said. Talking about the strained relationship that the Congress and the Sena had before they come together in Maharashtra, Jairam Ramesh said, "It is a matter of different perspectives, outlook and the approach, which is also a fact. MVA was formed only three years ago and both Shiv Sena and Congress were political opponents till then. We came together over a common minimum program and formed the government."</p>
