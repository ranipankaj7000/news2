        <p>Ajay Devgn's Drishyam 2 is all set to be his most successful film of 2022. The actor, who has not had a very pleasant time at the box office this year, is set to sign off in style though. As per trade sources, the sequel is expected to nett anywhere between â‚¹14-16 crore across India on its first day. This will mean the film stands to be in the top three opening days for Bollywood films this year.
