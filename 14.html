        <p>A 39-year-old woman was on Friday shot dead by an unidentified person outside Punjab's Bathinda bus stand. Eyewitnesses said the woman was standing near a parked car, when a masked man came from behind the car, and fired shots at her before fleeing the spot.</p>
        <p>The victim was rushed to the Civil Hospital right away, where the doctor pronounced her dead. The deceased has been identified as Kulwinder Kaur, a resident of Hajiratan locality of Bathinda city, said Davinder Gill, deputy superintendent of police (DSP).</p>
        <p>Reacting to the incident, Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira slammed chief minister Bhagwant Mann for the complete collapse of the law and order situation in the state and said, “The other day@BhagwantMann while replying to @AmitShah was taunting him that law & order in PB is better than Up & Bihar but today’s brutal killing of a lady near police post in Bathinda in broad daylight shows PB is worse than Up & Bihar. Cm must take responsibility of murders!”, Khaira tweeted.</p>
        <p>Jairam Ramesh, however, said he had a long discussion with Sanjay Raut over the Savarkar issue. "I had a long discussion with Sanjay Raut. I told him that Rahul Gandhi had spoken his mind and the same was the case with your leadership. It has nothing to do with the MVA coalition," Jairam Ramesh said. Talking about the strained relationship that the Congress and the Sena had before they come together in Maharashtra, Jairam Ramesh said, "It is a matter of different perspectives, outlook and the approach, which is also a fact. MVA was formed only three years ago and both Shiv Sena and Congress were political opponents till then. We came together over a common minimum program and formed the government."</p>
